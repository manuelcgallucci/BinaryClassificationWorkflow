# BinaryClassificationWorkflow
Implementation of a Binary Classification Workflow using scikit learn for data with features. Verified using Bank Notes Authentification and Chronic Kidney Disease datasets

## Workflow

Data cleaning (missing values / NaN)
Data normalizing 
Model training (with cross validation)
Model test set with plotted results

## Datasets used:
Chronic Kidney Disease Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mansoordaku/ckdisease

Banknote Authentication Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication#
